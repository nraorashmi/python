    "The name of the function must describe the reason of using the function clearly and briefly.\n",
    "Each nested block should be properly indented and spaced.\n",
    "Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.\n",
    "Any args or input parameters should be placed within these parentheses\n",
    "The function first statement can be an optional statement- docstring or the documentation string of the function\n",
    "The code within every function starts with a colon (:) and should be indented (space)\n",
    "The statement return (expression) exits a function, optionally passing back a value to the caller. A return statement with no args is the same as return None.\n",
    "If a function argument's name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is generally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than use an abbreviation or spelling corruption. Thus class_ is better than clss. (Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a synonym.)"
