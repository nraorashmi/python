    "Enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets returns a list where as when enclosed in round parentheses returns a generator object.The major difference between a list comprehension and a generator expression is that a list comprehension produces the entire list while the generator expression produces one item at a time.They have lazy execution (producing items only when asked for).For this reason, a generator expression is much more memory efficient than an equivalent list comprehension."
